Q: How can I get my dataset into BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format?
============================================================================

A: The method is the same for any 
`BIDS application <http://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_, on this website you can 
find several tools for assisting transforming data from dicoms, niftis, and 
other formats into BIDS format. Our group typically uses 
`dcm2bids <https://cbedetti.github.io/Dcm2Bids/>`_. However, if you are 
starting from data which has already been converted the process can be more 
difficult.
